The two scripts have been used for the article to create plots of the transposition insertion sites along the genomes of interest.
Functions are defined in [functions.py](functions.py) and figures production for the article in [main.py](main.py). Importantly, the [main.py](main.py) is provided only as an example on the way to invoke the [functions.py](functions.py) script and must be adapted to specific input file names.
Please check the "example" folder for short instructions and sample input file.
